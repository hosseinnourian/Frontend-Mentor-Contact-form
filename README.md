# vue-contacts-form

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

Your challenge is to build out this contact form and make it look as close to the design as possible. Pay particular attention to making this form accessible. Building accessible forms is a key skill for front-end developers, so this is a perfect challenge to practice.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So, if you have something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
Receive form validation messages if:
A required field has been missed
The email address is not formatted correctly
Complete the form only using their keyboard
Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
